Though many critics thought that Chicago Hope had a better chance for survival than ER, the NBC series scored a surprise hit -- and over a decade later it was still firmly imbedded in the network's Thursday-night schedule, while Chicago Hope had long since vanished. Set largely in the emergency room of Chicago's fictional County General Hospital, ER focused on the professional and personal trials and tribulations of the unit's staff, with several subplots and story arcs weaving in and out of each hour-long episode. The regular cast for the first season consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton, Julianna Margulies as Head Nurse Carol Hathaway, and Noah Wyle as med student (and later doctor) John Carter. Of these actors, only Sherry Stringfield and Noah Wyle would still be on the series as it entered its second decade on the air -- and of these two, only Wyle had been on the show throughout its entire run (Stringfield retired from the series in season three, but returned five years later).\n\nLater principals, in order of their appearance, included Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano, Kellie Martin as med student Lucy Knight, Erik Palladino as Dr. Dave Malucci, Goran Visnjic as Dr. Luka Kovac, Ming-Na as Dr. Jing-Mei \"Deb\" Chen (a recurring character in season one who returned as a regular in season six), Maura Tierney as Nurse (and later Dr.) Abby Lockhart, Michael Michele as Dr. Cleo Finch, Sharif Atkins as Dr. Michael Gallant, Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Gregory Pratt, and Parminder Nagra as med student (and later doctor) Neela Rasgotra. Many of these characters' lives were intertwined romantically, while some of the characters were bitter enemies; all were uniformly fascinating. And just as in \"real life,\" there was nothing predictable about the exits of certain characters: some departed with tragic abruptness (Lucy Knight, Robert Romano), others simply bade farewell and moved on with their lives (Doug Ross, Carol Hathaway, Peter Benton); but no \"goodbye\" was as poignant and moving as the lingering illness and death of Mark Greene throughout the length and breadth of season eight. Though the plot emphasis was on the continuing characters, a number of prominent guest stars made memorable appearances during the series' decade-plus run. Alan Alda, Sally Field, and Bob Newhart were but three of the A-list entertainers who passed in and out of the doors of Chicago County. The winner of innumerable industry awards, ER has also earned a niche in media history as the most expensive dramatic series in TV history, reaching this particular plateau with its 13-million-dollar-per-episode average budget during the 1998-1999 season.

It is accompanied by a book. \n\nThe programme is presented by wine expert Oz Clarke and motoring journalist James May (of Top Gear fame), the former taking it upon himself to educate the latter about wine, in particular French wine. For several weeks, they travel around France's wine regions in an 1989 Jaguar XJ-S convertible. \n\nAlthough at times it gets quite technical, the programme is light in tone, much of its entertainment value deriving from the personality clashes between the refined gourmet Clarke and May, whom the former at one point describes as \"an utter scruff\". (This is ironic given that on Top Gear May has a habit of positioning himself as the gentleman of the three presenters.)\n\nMay is a far from ideal student and often behaves rather rudely and grumpily, being more interested in drinking wine than in talking about it. When he thinks Oz starts rambling too much, May blows on a whistle, dubbed the \"Ozillator\" (a pun on oscillator).\n\nAt the beginning of their journey, May is someone who likes to drink wine, but knows next to nothing about it. Clarke teaches him the basics about smells and texture and about grape varieties, shows him how wine is made, what wine goes with what food and also focuses the culture surrounding wine. The two visit wine makers of all kinds, from ones in small sheds to prestigious operations like Champagne Krug. Clarke quizzes May a few times, often with embarrassing results, but ultimately May does pick up certain things.","runtime":30,"status":"Ended","network":"BBC Two","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt0907614","tvdb_id":"80681","tvrage_id":"0","poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/3188.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/3188.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/3188.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/3188.jpg"},"watchers":1,"ratings":{"percentage":84,"votes":10,"loved":10,"hated":0},"genres":["Documentary"]},{"title":"Hey Arnold!","year":1996,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/hey-arnold","first_aired":844153200,"country":"United States","overview":"The adventures of a daydreaming, jazz-loving, football-headed 9-year-old, who lives in a boarding house with his grandparents and some eccentric boarders, encounters life in the city with his best friend Gerald, a loofah-haired kid, who is the keeper of the urban tales and coolest kid in class; and Helga, who torments him, but loves him secretly.","runtime":30,"status":"Ended","network":"Nickelodeon","air_day":"Daily","air_time":"6:30pm","certification":"TV-Y","imdb_id":"tt0115200","tvdb_id":"72005","tvrage_id":"3842","poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/3410.2.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/3410.2.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/3410.2.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/3410.2.jpg"},"watchers":1,"ratings":{"percentage":81,"votes":177,"loved":164,"hated":13},"genres":["Animation","Children"]},{"title":"Cops","year":1989,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/cops","first_aired":604742400,"country":"United States","overview":"Called the original reality show, COPS hit the airwaves in 1989, putting camera crews in police cars all across the United States.

What the world doesn't know is that long before Ryan became a cop, he pledged allegiance to a different band of brothers \u2013 a powerful Latino gang called Los Angelicos. \n\nWhen Ryan's best friend and police partner is senselessly killed by a notorious gang member, Ryan teams up with longtime Task Force member CASSIUS GREEN (RZA, \u201cG.I.

In this war between law enforcement and gangs, the series explores how only people who really know the streets can win the battle on the streets.\n\nDespite his profession, Ryan is still beholden to the gang's leader, JAVIER ACOSTA (Cliff Curtis, \u201cLive Free or Die Hard,\u201d \u201cTraining Day\u201d), the father figure Ryan has tried to make proud his entire life and the man who masterminded his entry into the police force.

Enterprise. The show began with the production of the 1964 pilot \"The Cage\". \"The Cage\" featured Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise captain Christopher Pike. The pilot was rejected by NBC executives as being too cerebral. In order to demonstrate the action-adventure potential of the series, another pilot entitled \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was produced. Replacing Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise captain was William Shatner who starred as Captain James T. Kirk. The new pilot also starred Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock who was the only character to return from the original pilot after NBC's rejection of \"The Cage\". Response to the second, action-oriented, pilot was good and NBC gave the go ahead to the series. \n\nThe series premiered on NBC on Thursday, September 8, 1966 in the 8:30-9:30 PM timeslot with the episode \"The Man Trap\". Critical response to the series was mixed and rating were lower than expected. In its second season, reoccurring guest star DeForest Kelley was added to the series' starring cast and the show was moved to Friday at 8:30. A decline in the ratings, however, prompted NBC to attempt to cancel the series after its second season, but a letter writing campaign by die hard fans of the show saved it from cancellation. An additional season of episodes were produced, but ratings continued to decline most likely due to the quality of the third season episodes and a bad 10:00 PM Friday night time slot. Despite another letter writing campaign, the series was finally cancelled after its third season. The last new episode \"Turnabout Intruder\" was shown on June 3, 1969. \n\nAfter its three year run Star Trek began running syndication where it was discovered by legion of new fans and became a phenomenon. The show inspired six features films, an animated series, and four additional spin-off television shows. Other spin-off's include novels, comic books, merchandise and an enormous amount of fan-fiction based on the series. Despite its short network run, Star Trek has become one of the most successful shows in television history. \n\nAside from its three main stars, Star Trek featured a large cast of reoccurring guest stars that includes James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Majel Barrett, and Grace Lee Whitney. Other notable guest stars include Diana Muldaur, Gary Lockwood, Ricardo Montalban, Sally Kellerman, Julie Newmar, Frank Gorshin, John Colicos, Roger C. Carmel, William Campbell, Ted Cassidy, Michael Ansara and Elisha Cook, Jr. Notable writers for the series include Gene Roddenberry, Gene L. Coon, George Clayton Johnson, Jerry Sohl, Jerome Bixby, Robert Bloch, Theodore Sturgeon, Harlan Ellison, David Gerrold, and D.C. Fontana.

The show required a large number of writers, and to this end operated an \"open door\" policy, accepting sketch ideas from anybody who wanted to contribute. With a large number of contributing writers, there was plenty of material to go round, and only the best ideas made it to the screen; thus the series was able to maintain a remarkably high quality of material across four series.

Based on the award-winning UK series, Grand Designs Australia is the first international format of the critically acclaimed show. The series charts the in-depth process of elaborate design projects undertaken by self-builders - from the initial details of blueprints, to the long and often arduous task of turning the designs into a practical living space. No design is too ambitious when it comes to creating your dream home. But discovering the hard realities that complicate your plans can often be too much to bear.
